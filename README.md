Initial exploration of the Samsung Simband records 
during orthostatic challenge of ME/CSF Patients
================================================

### An exploratory and statistical analysis of BHC Simband study of orthostatic challenge with ME/CSF patients

#### Katherine Chandler

This analysis is performed on a clinical data set (obtained from a non-profit medical clinic) and the data was collected for 50 individuals (25 controls and 25 patients presenting with symptoms of Myalgic Encephalopathy). 

There are two parts to the patient data that make up this study: 1) three individual cognitive tests based on the DANA platform for cognitive testing, and 2) biometric data recorded during the test session using the Samsung SimBand wearable device. The Samsung SimBand biometric data was measured at a rate of ~1 time per second and a total of 120 streams were recorded. The patients were subjected to a physical stress test (called the 'Lean-Test' and biometric data was collected throughout. My goal with this data set is to see if there is a 'signature' in the biophysical data (and possibly the cognitive tests) during or after the physical stress test that can predict if the patient is in the affected or control group.
